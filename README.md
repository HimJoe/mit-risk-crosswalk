A web portal for mapping AI governance frameworks to the MIT Risk Repository
![MIT Risk Repository Framework Crosswalk](https://himjoe.github.io/mit-risk-crosswalk/)

## Overview

This portal provides a comprehensive analysis of how various AI governance frameworks map to the MIT Risk Repository. By examining their complementary strengths, identifying potential gaps, and providing recommendations, organizations can establish more robust AI risk management practices.

## Features

- **Risk Category Analysis**: Detailed mapping of MIT Risk Repository categories (General, Technical, Governance, Operational, and Compliance risks) to various frameworks
- **Framework Profiles**: Comprehensive information about each governance framework, including focus areas, key components, and links to official resources
- **Coverage Heatmap**: Visual representation of how well each framework addresses specific risk categories
- **Recommendation Engine**: Actionable insights for organizations looking to establish AI governance practices
- **Resource Downloads**: Access to detailed crosswalk matrices, reports, and analysis tools
